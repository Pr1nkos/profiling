/*
  Warnings:

  - The primary key for the `User` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - You are about to drop the column `emailVerified` on the `User` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the column `image` on the `User` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - The `id` column on the `User` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - You are about to drop the `Account` table. If the table is not empty, all the data it contains will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the `Session` table. If the table is not empty, all the data it contains will be lost.
  - Made the column `email` on table `User` required. This step will fail if there are existing NULL values in that column.
